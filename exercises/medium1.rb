# Write a method that can rotate the last n digits of a number. For example:
def rotate_rightmost_digits(number, dig)
  number_digits = number.to_s.split('')
  return (number_digits[1..-1] + [number_digits[0]]).join.to_i if number_digits.size == dig
  front = number_digits[0..((number.size - dig) -3)]
  back = number_digits[(number.size - dig -2)..]
  back = back[1..-1] + [back[0]]
  result = front + back
  result.join.to_i

def rotate_rightmost_digits(number, n)
  number_digits = number.to_s.split('')
  number_digits[-n..-1] = rotate_array(number_digits[-n..-1])

# p rotate_rightmost_digits(735291, 4) == 732915
# p rotate_rightmost_digits(735291, 5) == 752913
# p rotate_rightmost_digits(735291, 6) == 352917


# If you take a number like 735291, and rotate it to the left, you get 352917.
# If you now keep the first digit fixed in place, and rotate the remaining digits,
# you get 329175. Keep the first 2 digits fixed in place and rotate again to 321759.
#  Keep the first 3 digits fixed in place and rotate again to get 321597.
# Finally, keep the first 4 digits fixed in place and rotate the final 2 digits
# to get 321579. The resulting number is called the maximum rotation of the
# original number.
# Write a method that takes an integer as argument, and returns the maximum
# rotation of that argument. You can (and probably should) use the
# rotate_rightmost_digits method from the previous exercise.
# Note that you do not have to handle multiple 0s.

# p max_rotation(3) == 3
# p max_rotation(35) == 53

# You have a bank of switches before you, numbered from 1 to n. Each switch is
# connected to exactly one light that is initially off. You walk down the row of
# switches and toggle every one of them. You go back to the beginning, and on
# this second pass, you toggle switches 2, 4, 6, and so on. On the third pass,
# you go back again to the beginning and toggle switches 3, 6, 9, and so on.
#  You repeat this process and keep going until you have been through n repetitions.

# Write a method that takes one argument, the total number of switches, and
# returns an Array that identifies which lights are on after n repetitions.

#Â Example with n = 5 lights:
# round 1: every light is turned on
# round 2: lights 2 and 4 are now off; 1, 3, 5 are on
# round 3: lights 2, 3, and 4 are now off; 1 and 5 are on
# round 4: lights 2 and 3 are now off; 1, 4, and 5 are on
# round 5: lights 2, 3, and 5 are now off; 1 and 4 are on
# The result is that 2 lights are left on, lights 1 and 4. The return value is [1, 4].
# With 10 lights, 3 lights are left on: lights 1, 4, and 9. The return value is [1, 4, 9].

# the word "freight" in it, we won't replace it. If we don't use \b, we would
# convert "freight" to "fr8".
